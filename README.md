# Santander Cycles Usage Analysis with Docking Station and Weather Data in London (2015 - 2023)

Share cycle usage analysis using [Santander Cycles hires data](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/greater-london-authority/london-bicycles?hl=en-GB&inv=1&invt=Abh_CA&project=firm-solution-441714-r2) by Greater London Authority, [docking station data](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/cycle-hire-availability) by Transport for London, and [weather data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset) in kaggle. This project mostly focus on usage analysis in 2016 to connect three different datasets of which periods are also different. Interactive Tableau dashboard for usage overview in 2016 can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/naoki.kojima/viz/london_cycle/Dashboard1?publish=yes).

# Project Background
Aming to optimize operation for share cycle in London, this project analyzes the usage data of Santander Cycles, connecting with dock station and weather data, to uncover ussage patterns and critical insights that will help operation team in Santander Cycles.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas.
- Monthly, weekly, daily, and hourly ussesage pattern. 
- Geological ussage overview in 789 dock stations for both hiring and parking bikes.
- Usage pattern in seven different weather conditions.
- Dock stations of which is lack of both available bike hirings and available parking docks.

Using large volumn datasets with total column of 83M, most of data expolring, cleaning, preparation and analysis were done in BigQuery environment using SQL query. Only selected data and tables were imported in Tableau for visualization.

# North Star Metrics and Dimensions
Customer Behaviour: Hiring, Parking  
Parking - Hiring: Number of gap between Parking and Hiring calculating by plus for Parking and minus for Hiring  
Time: Yearly, Montly, Weekly, Daily, Hourly  
Location: 789 dock stations in the city of London  
Exceed Dock Limit: Absolute number of "Parking - Hiring" exeeds total docks in stations meaning not available for eitehr parking bikes or hiring bikes. Showing plus in means Parking exceeds Hiring, and minus means Hiring exceeds Parking.  

# Data Structure
The database structure as seen below consists of three tables; Bike, Station, and Weather with a total row count of 83M.

Most of data prepation and analysis were conducted in BigQuery using SQL query.

# Executive Summary
Since 2015, the number of bike hires has shown a slight increase over three years, with a year-over-year (YoY) growth rate of 102%. However, this was followed by two consecutive years of YoY declines at -1%. The highest number of hires was recorded in 2022 (11M).  

Bike hires occur throughout the year, but their frequency is positively correlated with temperature rises and negatively correlated with temperature drops. As a result, the peak hiring period is during the summer, while winter sees a decline in hires.  
On weekdays, peak hiring and parking times align with commuting hours â€” morning arrivals at work and evening returns home. In the morning, bikes are predominantly hired in Zones 1 and 2 and parked in central London, particularly between 7:00 AM and 8:00 AM. Conversely, in the evening, bikes are hired in central London (City of London, Westminster, and Kensington) and parked back in Zones 1 and 2.  

Regarding bike and dock station availability, six locations experienced fully occupied dock stations with no available parking over 100 times in 2016. Similarly, three locations faced a lack of available bikes over 100 times. These "no availability" issues were concentrated in specific dock stations, indicating that addressing these locations would significantly improve operational efficiency.
